Run copy_html_code.py to copy to the clipboard the html code that will generate a publications list for a website.

To create a dedicated bibtex file for a new paper:
1. Add the bibtex information in lsdo_conference.bib or lsdo_journal.bib in the raw_bib directory.
2. Run write_individual_bib_files.py to regenerate separate .bib files for each paper.
3. Commit to the main branch and push to keep the repository up to date.
4. Switch to the gh-pages branch and upload the new html bib file in the bib/ directory (this can be done within the browser on GitHub, rather than dealing with switching between branches in terminal).
